## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
Required Python libraries are imported for model building, numerical computation, and visualization.

### 2. Dataset Loading
The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Image pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] to improve training efficiency and stability.

### 4. Data Augmentation
Random image transformations such as horizontal flipping and rotation are applied during training to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

### 5. Model Architecture Design
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed using:
- Convolution layers for feature extraction  
- Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
- Dense layers for classification  

### 6. Model Compilation
The model is compiled using:
- Adam optimizer  
- Categorical cross-entropy loss  
- Accuracy metric  

### 7. Model Training
The CNN is trained on the training dataset for multiple epochs with validation monitoring.

### 8. Performance Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure classification accuracy.

### 9. Prediction and Results
The model predicts the class labels of unseen images and compares them with actual labels.
